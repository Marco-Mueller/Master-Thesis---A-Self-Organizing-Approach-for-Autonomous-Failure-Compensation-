Demonstarting failure compensation mechanims during a fire surpression mission:

# Regular execution of the fire surpression mission
//TODO: Link
# Compensating for a failure to execute a capability due to changed envrionmental circumstances
//TODO: Link
# Coordinator failures where the coordinator was the sole remaining agent in its ensemble
//TODO: Link
# Coordinator failures with a remainign ensemble
