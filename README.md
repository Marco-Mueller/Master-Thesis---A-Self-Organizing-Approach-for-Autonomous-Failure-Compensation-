# Master Thesis - A Self-Organizing Approach for Autonomous Failure Compensation in Flying Multi-Robot-Ensembles

Demonstrating failure compensation mechanisms during a fire suppression mission:

# Experimental validation of demo scenarios

## 1) Coordinator failures with a remaining ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 2) Coordinator failures with no remaining ensemble 
//TODO: Link
## 3) Follower Failures
//TODO: Link
## 4) Capability failures 
//TODO: Link

# Validation for the case study scenario

## 5) Regular execution of the fire suppression mission
//TODO: Link
## 6) Compensating for a failure to execute a capability due to changed environmental circumstances
//TODO: Link
## 7) Coordinator failures where the coordinator was the sole remaining agent in its ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 8) Coordinator failures with a remaining ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 9) Folower agent failures
//TODO: Link
