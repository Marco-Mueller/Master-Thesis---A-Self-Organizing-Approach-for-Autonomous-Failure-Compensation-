# Validation of the case study scenario

## Video_5) Regular execution of the fire suppression mission

The following scenarios still require adaptions in the source code, to achieve failure compensation during the main mission. 
For now, the combination of both the execution of the main mission and the demonstration of the failure compensation mechanism 
act as a proof of concept that failure compensation can be achieved during complex mission in the future as well. 

## Video_6) Compensating for a failure to execute a capability due to changed environmental circumstances
Video 5 shows the regular execution of the main mission\
Video 4 shows the compensation mechanism when a fire is too big to be extinguished by a single agent
## Video_7) Coordinator failures where the coordinator was the sole remaining agent in its ensemble
Video 5 shows the regular execution of the main mission\
Video 2 shows the failure compensation when the affected ensemble only consists of the malfunctioned coordinator
## Video_8) Coordinator failures with a remaining ensemble
Video 5 shows the regular execution of the main mission\
Video 2 shows the compensation mechanism when the affected ensemble of the malfunctioned coordinator still has remaining functional members
## Video_9) Folower agent failures
Video 5 shows the regular execution of the main mission\
Video 3 shows the compensation mechanism when a follower agent malfunctions and the coordinator retains all functionality
