Master Thesis - A Self-Organizing Approach for Autonomous Failure Compensation in Flying Multi-Robot-Ensembles

Demonstarting failure compensation mechanims during a fire surpression mission:

# Experimental validation of demo scenarios

## 1) Coordinator failures with a remaining ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 2) Coordinator failures with no remaining ensmble 
//TODO: Link
## 3) Follower Failures
//TODO: Link
## 4) Capability failures 
//TODO: Link

# Validation for the case study scenario

## 5) Regular execution of the fire surpression mission
//TODO: Link
## 6) Compensating for a failure to execute a capability due to changed envrionmental circumstances
//TODO: Link
## 7) Coordinator failures where the coordinator was the sole remaining agent in its ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 8) Coordinator failures with a remainign ensemble
//TODO: Link
## 9) Folower agenf failures
//TODO: Link
