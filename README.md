Demonstarting failure compensation mechanims during a fire surpression mission:

# 1) Regular execution of the fire surpression mission
//TODO: Link
# 2) Compensating for a failure to execute a capability due to changed envrionmental circumstances
//TODO: Link
# 3) Coordinator failures where the coordinator was the sole remaining agent in its ensemble
//TODO: Link
# 4) Coordinator failures with a remainign ensemble
//TODO: Link
# 5) Folower agenf failures
